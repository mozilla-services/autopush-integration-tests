autopush integration tests
============================

Summary
---------

A variety of tests are used to verify the integrity of [Mozilla's autopush service](https://autopush.readthedocs.io/)].
This repository contains integration tests used largely for deployment verification.

Other tests / test tools used for testing autopush include:
For API testing: [ap-loadtester](https://github.com/mozilla-service/ap-loadtester) 
For loadtesting (API testing at scale): [ardere](https://github.com/loads/ardere) 


autopush integration tests will live here.  For now, use bash scripts in /scripts for
manual verification of push deployment
